            <p>
              This was my first major project contracted under OTP Design-works.
              I was initially responsible for the continued development of an
              existing freight management system. Their company handles
              compost/waste disposal, and their system utilized a few Zoho based
              applications, as well as an external freight management
              application titled
              <a href="https://fluid-mobility.com/">Fluid Mobility (FM)</a>. The
              goal of the project was to integrate Fluid Mobility into their
              existing Creator application, initialize a CRM based off Microsoft
              Excel sheets previously used for customer management, and general
              debugging/coding quality insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was my first experience creating forms, reports, and pages in
              Zoho Creator; however, It gave me some development fundamentals I
              still use today! I scripted the API to handle crucial data on
              tagged trucks/trailers between Creator – FM, and I even had a hand
              in developing atop the tool we used to convert their Excel based
              contacts into Zoho Creator records with Zoho CRM foreign key
              connections.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’d say the biggest take-away in terms of valuable experience from
              this project was communicating with clients, creating effective
              scope outlines, and establishing a “plan of attack” in terms of
              task management.

            <p>
              In-between contracts I was assigned to, I was responsible for
              numerous outstanding issues and incomplete projects for OTP’s
              sister company Eco Paints and Coating Supplys. They had created a
              Zoho Creator based page for their POS (Point of Sales) system,
              utilizing an array of Zoho applications, as well as some external
              apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a list of the largest tasks I was assigned (In order of
              complexity/size):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                CRM work flow overhaul
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I had worked on an existing CRM system that required data
                    normalization and full circle integration between Zoho CRM,
                    Books, and creator. This integration was used to ensure data
                    congruency across multiple platforms for made payments and
                    contact details.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Brand new “Team member Portal”
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    They required a custom landing page for contractors,
                    sub-contracts, and employees to track job statuses, handle
                    site photo uploads, and email/alert automation based on job
                    statuses. The portal also gave a means to see upcoming jobs
                    based on current user log-in, and access to crucial
                    documents for site procedures.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Google Calendar/Zoho Calendar Integration
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I integrated Calendar event creation, deletion, and edit
                    based on form events or schedules within the POS Creator
                    app. This integration was achieved utilizing Zoho Flow, and
                    weirdly Zoho Creator’s API? It takes a bit of insider
                    knowledge to understand, but basically Zoho Flow’s on create
                    flows only execute when preforming a “manual” form entry.
                    Meaning if the Form entry is created via the “insert”
                    syntax, the flow won’t trigger. Defiantly was a struggle
                    point at the start of development, since the online
                    documentation makes no word of this.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Front-end page stylizing & mobile accessibility
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The POS was first made 7 years ago, so the styling was a bit
                    limited, and techniques were outdated. I was responsible for
                    making the page more accessible, responsive design in case
                    the store-front PC’s went down or a mobile view was needed,
                    and made minor changes to overall style/feel.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Working on the POS gave me the majority of my working experience
              as a software developer, as well as my expert knowledge on all of
              Zoho’s major web applications. I gained quite a bit of HTML, CSS,
              and Bootstrap experience while learning how to effectively work on
              a live site.

              Similar to payment processors like Intelli Pay. Our Payment
              processor was made to give competitive rates on transactions
              between our business partners. I was responsible for integrating a
              new payment option under an existing integration, as well as
              general debugging on both the front and back end. We allowed for
              saved payment details using tokenizations and additional security
              measures. The processor used a combination of Zoho Creator, Books,
              and PHP hosted on Linux.

              I was referenced by a friend for a steps public art program. They
              were looking for a banner design to string up for Pride Month, and
              since they were expecting something "Summer themed" this is what I
              came up with. The project had It's complication, mainly with my
              abilitys to translate my art into digital media. I do have prior
              experience using photo editing and drawing software, but I
              struggled to find a program on Ubuntu, and Wine emulated programs
              don't support pressure sensativity. I ended up completing the
              design/final work on Krita, and the banner design was installed in
              various locations.
